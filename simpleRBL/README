simplerbl.pm: This is the spamassassin plugin that checks incoming emails, and stores evidences and records in the filesystem to be processed later by a worker process. You should place this module wherever your spamassasin plugins are in your system.

simplerbl.cf: This is the main spamassassin configuration file. Just keep in mind that the two directories where the plugin stores data must be writeable by the user running spamassassin. The example file uses:
		- simplerbl_redir /var/log/spamassassin/records   (xml files with the data (IP, mail from, triggered SA rules, date, ...) from spam messages (above 5 points in this example)).
		- simplerbl_evdir /var/log/spamassassin/evidences (Headers of stored spam messages to be reported back to the mail-abuse team of the spammer's IP address owner).

simplerbl.cfg: Main configuration file. [DNSFile] and [ReportGenerator] are still not uploaded.
		- [Worker]: This is the cofiguration of the worker script.
		- [DNSFile]: This is the configuration of the script that generates de rbldnsd files.
		- [ReportGenerator]: This is the configuration of the script that notifies about spam to IP address owners. (ARF, ...).

simplerblWorker.pl: Example worker script that reads the records created by spamassassin and stores them in a database. It currently uses postgresql, but there's nothing special in the database schema that would prevent anyone from using mysql (for example). The script is very simple: It stores new IP addresses in the database, and increases the counter for the already listed. We manage three different lists: low, medium and high, depending on the spam score, that will then be translated to independent rbl lists (like sbl, pbl, xbl, ..., but with low, medium, high). If I had to make the system useful, I would probably use a different approach. I would classify according to the spamassassin rules triggered by the message, for example:
	- 127.0.0.2: Regular spam (drugs, ...). The database-to-rbl script would list IPs after n spam messages.
	- 127.0.0.3: Bank, credit card, .... The script would list IPs after n/2 messages.
	- 127.0.0.4: .... The script would list IPs after 1 message, and mark them permanent.
