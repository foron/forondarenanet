This is the README file describing the software available at forondarena.net.


findASN.pl:

	This utility takes a file as an argument and gives the ASN number and the country of the addresses included. It also shows the amount of IPs that are part of each ASN in the file.
	If an ASN number is listed more than n times, it will also report the owner of the ASN.


mapreduce:
	Simple Hadoop MapReduce application for managing logs generated by a postfix+amavis email system.


SimpleRBL:

	This is a project I started (and never finished) long ago. I guess I will never finish it, but some of the components are completed, and might be useful.

	Simplerbl is another email blacklisting application, just in case you want your own spamhaus at home (I can't imagine why you should want that anyway).
